# Synchronic Web

The Synchronic Web is infrastructure for data assurance. Each journal maintains immutable, cryptographically linked records. Reciprocal bridges exchange root-signed heads so journals can preserve and inspect verifiable cross-journal history without requiring global consensus. Applications can retain selective proof material and verify data against an exact committed journal state.

## Federation model

Sync Web 1.6 uses reciprocal bridges for identity, proof reachability, and signed-head synchronization. A bridge grants no application-data access by itself. Remote application calls are delivered directly to the terminal journal, whose local policy may independently authorize staged blank read-only `use!`/`put!`, dedicated `use-batch!`/`put-batch!`, path-scoped staged `run!`, and committed `retrieve`. Namespace ownership and blank read-only `use!` do not imply `run!`; nested operations preserve and recheck the original caller. Retention, including administrator-only `prune!` / `prune-batch!` removal from temporary and permanent retained history, bridge/configuration changes, access policy, administration, secrets, windows, periodic configuration, and root-plane control remain local. Ready routes retain their exact public reverse-key material across process boundaries and unchanged Journal restarts. Optional `index?` metadata on committed resolution reports the exact absolute local and per-hop indexes selected without changing existing responses by default. An explicit `$federation.route` may also select one terminal responder for permanent-only retained `retrieve`/`retrieve-batch`; responder-local paths and structural Chain inventories expose exact retained evidence without provider search or contacting the attributed source, and each parent-relative `-1` selects the greatest materialized index in its containing permanent Chain. [`docs/ideas/federation.md`](docs/ideas/federation.md) is retained only as a historical, superseded design note; this README and the shipped documentation describe the current protocol and trust model.

## Isolated stored programs

`run!` executes a staged Scheme procedure under root/configured-local-admin default authority or an independent recursive path-scoped Authorization rule. Interface evaluates it outside `sync-let` in a masked environment and supplies the authenticated Journal capability. Namespace ownership and blank read-only `use!` do not imply execution; authenticated local non-admin and federated route principals may receive `run!` explicitly. Sync Web 1.6 makes no deterministic execution-meter, limit, budget, timeout, or meter-configuration claim. Every nested operation preserves and rechecks the original caller, and capabilities cannot escape. Shared self-coded object work separately runs through fresh `sync-let` children cloned from a sealed request-local capability template; no mutable child, result, proof, or application state is cached across boundaries.

## Repository Layout

| Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| `journal/` | Rust journal-sdk: HTTP server, S7 Scheme evaluator, RocksDB persistence |
| `records/` | Scheme record logic: `root`, `standard`, `tree`, `chain`, `ledger`, `federation`, `authorization`, `interface` |
| `services/` | Web services: `gateway`, `router`, `explorer`, `workbench`, `file-system` |
| `deploy/` | Single-node Compose-compatible container deployment |
| `tests/` | API smoke tests, load tests, multi-node network tests |
| `docs/` | Documentation site (Astro/Starlight) |
| `scripts/` | Compact check orchestration and read-only network diagnostics |

## Quickstart

The fastest way to run a local stack:

```sh
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=sync-local SYNC_WEB_VERSION=1.6.0 \
SECRET=your-root-secret INTERFACE_SECRET=your-interface-secret \
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-login-password HTTP_PORT=8192 HTTPS_PORT=8193 \
docker compose -f deploy/compose/general/compose.yaml up
```

Use `podman-compose` or `podman compose` instead of `docker compose` if that is your container runtime. Sync Web 1.6 requires a fresh database: preserve a 1.5.x volume and its exact runtime for read-only historical access rather than opening it with 1.6. See `deploy/compose/general/README.md` for full configuration options, `tests/release-qa/README.md` for exact-image acceptance checks, and `docs/development-checks.md` for validation commands and tool dependencies.
