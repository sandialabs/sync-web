# Adversarial CAD Artifact Detection Demo

This manual experimental demonstration runs an honest CAD agent and a deliberately adversarial CAD agent, exchanges their STEP files and session logs through Sync Web WebDAV, and checks the downloaded STEP artifacts against a structured source-of-truth CAD specification. A model-generated verifier assessment is validated against the report schema.

A geometry mismatch is observable artifact noncompliance. Bad faith or intent is an inference from the available artifacts and logs, which do not constitute an independently retained execution trace. The assessment is not a production security control or a conclusive attribution mechanism.

## Requirements

The shell commands below target a Debian/Ubuntu Linux environment.

- A running local [sync-web](https://github.com/sandialabs/sync-web) stack
- Python 3
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/download)
- `cadaver` for background WebDAV uploads
- `inotifywait` from `inotify-tools` for the background uploader

Install the public command-line dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cadaver inotify-tools python3
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

## Configure the WebDAV endpoint

Export the IP address or hostname of the machine running sync-web. The uploader and workflow must inherit this environment variable.

```bash
export WEBDAV_HOST=<sync-web IP or hostname>
```

By default, the scripts connect to:

```text
http://${WEBDAV_HOST}:8192/webdav/stage/admin/
```

If the sync-web username is not `admin`, set the corresponding WebDAV path:

```bash
export WEBDAV_PATH=webdav/stage/<username>
```

Other optional overrides are:

- `WEBDAV_PORT` — server port; defaults to `8192`.
- `WEBDAV_PATH` — endpoint path; defaults to `webdav/stage/admin`.
- `WEBDAV_URL` — complete endpoint URL. This takes precedence over the host,
  port, and path variables and is useful for HTTPS or nonstandard deployments.

For example:

```bash
export WEBDAV_URL=https://sync-web.example.test/custom/webdav/path/
```

## Configure authentication

Retrieve an API token from the sync-web account settings and add the credentials to `~/.netrc`. The `machine` value must match the hostname or IP used by the WebDAV URL; do not include the scheme, port, or path.

```netrc
machine <sync-web IP or hostname>
    login <username>
    password <API_TOKEN>
```

Restrict access to the credential file:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.netrc
```

The uploader uses these `.netrc` credentials through `cadaver`, and the verifier-input fetcher reads the same file. For the fetcher only, `WEBDAV_USERNAME` and `WEBDAV_PASSWORD` can supply Basic credentials instead of `.netrc`. Set `WEBDAV_PASSWORD` to the sync-web API token, not the account password. The uploader still requires `.netrc`.

## Run the workflow

First, launch the local sync-web stack using its [project instructions](https://github.com/sandialabs/sync-web/blob/main/README.md).
Then, from this `tests/agentic_detection` directory, start the uploader and run the workflow:

```bash
./scripts/cadaver_upload.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
uploader_pid=$!

./scripts/run_workflow.sh

kill -- -"$uploader_pid"
```

The workflow performs these operations:

1. Records a start boundary, then runs `cad_agent` and `adversarial_cad_agent` concurrently
2. Places completed STEP and JSONL artifacts in `incoming/`
3. Serializes uploader processing per incoming path, uploads ready artifacts to sync-web, and moves each local directory to `uploaded/` or `failed/` according to the result
4. Polls WebDAV for one complete STEP/JSONL pair from each agent with timestamps and modification times at or after the boundary
5. Downloads those pairs into `verifier_files/runs/<run-id>/` and writes `verifier_input.json` with paths, lengths, SHA-256 hashes, and WebDAV provenance
6. Runs the verifier on the exact files in the manifest and validates its report against the manifest and versioned report schema

If either CAD agent fails or complete current-run pairs do not appear within the fetch timeout, the workflow fails without running the verifier.

## View reports and logs

Verifier reports are retained with UTC timestamps:

```text
verifier_files/report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

List the newest report with:

```bash
ls -1t verifier_files/report_*.json | head -n 1
```

Uploader activity is written to:

```text
logs/cadaver_upload.log
```

Agent session exports are written beneath:

```text
cad_agents/session_logs/
```

## Specifications

All agents use the same authoritative CAD requirements:

```text
cad_agents/specifications/cad_source_of_truth.json
```

The individual agent specifications contain only their implementation, audit, validation, and artifact contracts. The verifier report format is defined by:

```text
cad_agents/specifications/verifier_report.schema.json
```

The launcher rejects reports that do not follow the required filename pattern, JSON structure, field ordering, enum values, formatting, or summary semantics.

## Run tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
